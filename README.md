## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I thought that this project will be easy, But after exploring different repositories of the other developers who completed this project, I learned that there are a lot of things and users to consider when creating a component no matter if its a simple or complex. Some of things that I learn while creating this project are creating an inclusive design for Tabbed Interfaces and Cards.

### Continued development

For this project I want to continue developing the keydown events for keyboard users

### Useful resources

- [WAI Tabs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) - This helped me for creating an accessible tabbed interface.
- [Tabbed Interfaces](https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/) - This helped me for creating my tabbed interface component, I really like this article because it covers almost everything of the users scenario and provides good example.
- [Cards](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/) - This helped me for creating an accessible cards, I really like this article because it covers almost everything of the users scenario and provides good example.
